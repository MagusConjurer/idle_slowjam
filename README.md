# idle_slowjam
My project for the Portland Indie Game Squad game jam titled [Summer Slow Jam 2023: Idle](https://itch.io/jam/ssjidle)

### Purpose
The goal I have in mind for this game jam is to keep my development active over the summer break and increase my familiarity with UE5. It also provides a deadline and theme to focus my creative energy on.
